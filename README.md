# JAMFO Website (local)

Quick notes:

- Fixed email typos: updated contact address to `jamuiyatarshadmuslimfoundation@gmail.com`.
- Renamed hero image to `assets/images/hero-image.jpg` and updated references.
- Updated CSS to use `Poppins` font and point `.hero` background to the hero image.
- Membership form: action left as `#` and JS will simulate submission locally. To enable real submissions, set the form `action` to your Formspree endpoint (e.g. `https://formspree.io/f/<your_id>`).

How to test locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Submit the membership form — the page will simulate a successful submission if no endpoint is configured.

If you want, I can update the form action to your real Formspree ID or configure a different endpoint.
